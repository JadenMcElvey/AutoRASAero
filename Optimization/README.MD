# Genetic Algorithm Setup
## Additional Python Packages
The genetic algorithm implementation in GeneticAlgorithm.ipynb makes use of two additional python 
packages, numpy and scipy. The installation instructions are listed below.
1. Run `pip install numpy` to install [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/).
2. Run `pip install scipy` to install [Scipy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/).
## Notes on Notebook Environments
While a version of the notebook written out as a plain python file exists the notebook 
file(the file with the .ipynb extension) is the primary version of the genetic algorithm optimization.
If you've never worked with python in a notebook environment there are two possible ways to do it.
1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). This download will come with it's own python installation with
the Numpy and Scipy packages already included.
2. Notebook files can be edited in VSCode using the VSCode notebook extension. This will require
manual installation of Numpy and Scipy.
